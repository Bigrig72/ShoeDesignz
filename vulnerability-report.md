# Vulnerability Report

This report is to provide some possible vulnerabilities that would have existed in the program’s code and safeguards or repairs put in place.

##### This Audit report is based on OWASP Assessment List


## Sensitive Data Exposure
- Sensitive data exposure occurs when data is not secured properly.  This data generally includes names, passwords, payment information, or any other sensitive material that should not be seen by anyone other than the user.  All sensitive information should use an encryption with a strong hash that is sprinkled with “salt”.
- In the .NET-Core Framework, the strongest hashing algorithm in implemented using PBKDF2.
DOES NOT: Store encrypted passwords.
DOES: Use strong hash encryption with a minimum complexity password that use the full character set(numbers, symbols, and letters).
Repair:  The developers ensured to use the ASP.NET Core for the password security logic.  Microsoft maintains a strong hashing algorithm that once the password is registered by the user, not even the developer can see it.
```
[Required]
[DataType(DataType.Password)]
public string Password { get; set; }
```
This ensures that if the location of the password in the database is found, it’s still encrypted using a hash that should be impossible to decrypt.

## SQL Injection
- SQL Injection is when malicious code is inserted into strings. These strings contain SQL syntax terminating characters which allow the attacker to 'inject' additional SQL statements.
- Basically an attacker could override data, return data, and manipulate data using strings.
