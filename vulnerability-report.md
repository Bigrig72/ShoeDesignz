# Vulnerability Report

This report is to provide some possible vulnerabilities that would have existed in the program’s code and safeguards or repairs put in place.

### This Audit report is based on OWASP Assessment List


## Sensitive Data Exposure
- Sensitive data exposure occurs when data is not secured properly.  This data generally includes names, passwords, payment information, or any other sensitive material that should not be seen by anyone other than the user.  All sensitive information should use an encryption with a strong hash that is sprinkled with “salt”.
- In the .NET-Core Framework, the strongest hashing algorithm in implemented using PBKDF2.
- DOES NOT: Store encrypted passwords.
- DOES: Use strong hash encryption with a minimum complexity password that use the full character set(numbers, symbols, and letters).
###### Repair:  
The developers ensured to use the ASP.NET Core for the password security logic.  Microsoft maintains a strong hashing algorithm that once the password is registered by the user, not even the developer can see it.
```
[Required]
[DataType(DataType.Password)]
public string Password { get; set; }
```
This ensures that if the location of the password in the database is found, it’s still encrypted using a hash that should be impossible to decrypt.

## SQL Injection
- SQL Injection is when malicious code is inserted into strings. These strings contain SQL syntax terminating characters which allow the attacker to 'inject' additional SQL statements.
- Basically an attacker could override data, return data, and manipulate data using strings.
###### Repair:
The entity framework helps prevent sql injections by passing all data to the database via SQL paramaters.  
```
List<Order> orders =  await _context.Order.Where(e => e.UserID == cart.UserID).ToListAsync(); 
```
Because the SQL database is set up to only accept parameters, passing in strings will produce an error and only return errors.

## CreditCard Safety
- Encrypting and sending a credit card authorization requires a high level security.   Despite having token/keys kept in a secret file needed to transmit credit card numbers, hackers are always looking for way to find these numbers.
##### Repair:
To prevent any attack and because this is a mock e-commerce store, the user is only given the options to select from a drop down menu.  The numbers in the drop down menu are special assigned numbers used by developers for testing purposes only.

## Unvalidated redirects and forwards
- A website can be navigated to pages not displayed by simply typing a directory in the url bar.  This means a user can bypass login and go straight to the inventory or admin page. 
##### Repair:
To prevent this, the MVC in ASP.NET Core allows us to create special model states that require a user to be logged in before access these pages.
```
if (!SignInManager.IsSignedIn(User))
        {
            <a asp-controller="Example" asp-action="Register">Register</a>
            <a asp-controller="Example" asp-action="Login">Login</a>
        }
        else
```
This only allows access to certain directories once logged in and even set special limits to special users and full access to admin users.
